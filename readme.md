## a GLSL fractal renderer by Will Ridgers

Not much to say here. Uses a GLSL fragment shader to render a mandelbrot
fractal. I get about 1000FPS on a GTX 670 at the standard zoom/iteration level.

### Requirements

You will need GLFW and GLEW to compile. I have included the Windows headers and
libs for these, on Linux you'll need to install them yourself. I have also
included a VS2012 solution in the build directory.
